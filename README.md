# VOID BONE: Integrated SDK (v1.3)
### - Autonomous Inference Control Module -

[Product State: Protocol DONE]
This repository serves as a structural reference for the VOID BONE architecture. 

## ■ Structural Integrity & Compliance
This is a finished digital asset provided as-is. All execution responsibility rests with the implementer.

## ■ Core Principles
- **HOLD by default**: Execution stops safely if internal conditions (State) do not match.
- **Local-only decision making**: No external signaling, no server dependency.
- **NE-Audit Integration**: Cryptographically signed decisions via HMAC-chain for immutable reference.
- **Non-removable, Time-limited**: Integrated logical locks for production environments.

## ■ Absolute Disclaimers (The Wall)
1. **Transfer of Responsibility**: By referencing or integrating this logic, the User (Implementer) assumes full and exclusive responsibility. The Provider is not liable for host system failures or logical conflicts.
2. **Audit Evidence**: The NE-Audit log serves as mathematical proof of performance. Liability for ignoring "HOLD" signals rests entirely with the Operator.
3. **Prior Art Notice**: This logic was architected and established by norisan (NEXTBASE) as of January 2026.

## ■ Acquisition
